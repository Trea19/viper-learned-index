<h1 align="center">An In-depth Inquiry into Learned Indexes in a Practical Environment [Experiment, Analysis & Benchmark]</h1>

### ABSTRACT
The learned indexes, which introduce the artificial intelligence technology into the index design, have become a very popular research direction due to their benefits on both space and time overheads. Recently, numerous updatable learned indexes have been designed to support the writing requirements in practical systems, and the source codes of many proposed learned indexes have been opened.
However, we do not find any practical database or storage system
that has replaced traditional indexes with the new learned indexes;
people still have a concern about whether learned indexes used in
practical systems can behave as good as what were described in
the research papers. Therefore, this paper makes a comprehensive
and in-depth evaluation on the end-to-end performance of learned
indexes in real environments. Furthermore, we deconstruct the design of learned indexes into multiple dimensions and evaluate their
impacts on the overall performance, respectively. According to the
above results and analyses, we give some constructive suggestions
on how to design a better learned index.
